# Extending Unmail

Unmail provides two primary ways to extend its functionality:

1. [**Creating Custom Drivers**](/docs/extending-unmail/creating-drivers): For more extensive customization, you can create entirely new drivers. This approach is useful when you need to support a new email service or implement completely custom email handling logic.

2. [**Modifying Request Payloads**](/docs/extending-unmail/modifying-payloads): You can customize how Unmail interacts with email services by modifying the request payloads. This allows you to adapt the requests to your specific needs without creating an entirely new driver.


Choose the approach that best suits your needs - payload modification for smaller customizations, or custom drivers for more comprehensive changes.
